  <h2>UMD's Vietnam War Protest</h2>
  <p>During the 1970s is when campus activity really boomed. President Nixon decided to enter Cambodia during the Vietnam War and campus exploded. According to the Washington Post on May 4, 1970, “[the protest] largest and most violent in the university’s history”. The Post reported about 2,000 students and 250 police officers. Route 1, a typical entrance to the university, was shut down by students. According to UMDarchives students “[threw] bricks, rocks, and bottles and slash tires”.
An undergraduate student explained to the Washington Post on May 7th what made her protest, “It’s Cambodia that did it for me.”
According to UMDarchives, the National Guard was brought in on several different occasions to disperse students. On the seventh day of protest the governor issued “executive order restricting access to University of Maryland’s campus, including its grounds, roads and buildings until further notice”.</p>
