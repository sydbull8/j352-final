  <h2>Jordan McNair Protest</h2>
  <p>Most students are aware of the death of UMD football player Jordan McNair and its controversy. McNair died in June 2018 from heat stroke during a team workout according to dbknews. The student response to how the administration handled and conducted the wrongful death was outrage. November 1, 2018 students gathered outside McKeldin Library to protest in a rally named Justice for Jordan according to dbknews.
A student named Tiffany Castillo said, “I am here to get Justice for Jordan. It is not enough that Coach Durkin is fired. President Loh needs to go.”
The protest started united, yet the Student Government Association and other student groups demanded that students attend more football games to support student-athletes according to dbknews. Some that attended the event were dissatisfied with the SGA’s suggestions and because of it they were “criticized as tone-deaf for trying to rally support for football and not advocating for true change for minority students on campus” according to Inside Higher Ed.</p>
