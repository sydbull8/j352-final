  <h2>McKeldin Protest</h2>
  <p>One of the most spur of the moment protests that occurred most recently on campus was September 17, 2019. Controversial religious demonstrators that claimed they were from the Key David Christian Center, were on McKeldin Mall in front of the library waving signs that read, “Obey Jesus”, “Cover up girls”, “Jesus or hellfire” and more signs. Hundreds of students came to counter protest them with songs, yelling, flinging dildos or water-filled condoms. A group of women students even took their shirts off and stood in bras. </p>
