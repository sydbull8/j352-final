    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>College is a notorious place for young adults to find their voice in life and express it. That voice can often be displayed through acts of protest to authoritative figures or laws. University of Maryland students have lined up with posters and expressed their differences with stated opinion and/or fact on many instances. These protests were not all traditionally loud voices with signs as well, some of these protests were silent and some were online, but they did not lack creativity.</p>
