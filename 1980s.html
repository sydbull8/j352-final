  <p>UMD repeated large except silent protests in the 1980s when apartheid was occurring in South Africa. November 19, 1985, the Diamondback reported that UMD had more than $9 million invested in firms conducting business in South Africa and students called for “divestment”, a term meaning to take investments away. University Divestment Coalition organized this which included the Black Student Union and MaryPIRG. They first conducted a petition which garnered more than 1,000 signatures. Madge McQueen, a campus former activist said in this article, “Students should realize their actions affect the larger political scene and that silence is complicity.”
Students then brought shantytowns in on McKeldin Mall as a way of silent protest. May 2nd, 1985, Lynn Rodgers responded to a student’s column on the ugliness of the shantytowns in the Diamondback, “He lacks the intellect or the heart to understand that the reality is that people live in shantytowns.” Jay Scheiner originally said in his column “[Shantytown’s are] an ugly way to protest”.</p>
