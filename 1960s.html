    <h2>Black Student Union's Protest</h2>
  <p>The 1960s led up to University of Maryland’s campus unrest. According to the Baltimore Sun, 80 students in April 25, 1968 walked out during Wilson H. Elkins convocation address. They attempted to present a list of grievances to him, which was prevented by Maryland State Police from reaching him.
Their protest included, “more black professors and advisors” and “more courses on Negro history, art and literature”.
Elkins responded to this by saying, “[University of Maryland] should remain an educational institution equipped primarily to teach, not an activist agency for it cannot endure as such.” He also stated, according to the Baltimore Sun, “He refused to involve the university as a whole in controversial debates on civil rights, and the Vietnam war.” Black Student Union was formed shortly after this incident in May 1968.</p>
