    <h2>Valerie Solanas's Protest</h2>
    <p>UMD was fairly quiet, until the <span class="color">1950s</span> when <span class="color">Valerie Solanas</span> attended. She wrote for the Diamondback and was known for the famous “War of Pens”. “War of Pens” was a series of articles Solonas went back and forth with Max Shulman, a newspaper columnist that produced “On Campus with Max Shulman”. This lasted approximately three months with at least 15 exchanges, according to UMDarchives blog. They went back and forth with articles about a woman's place, destroying matriarchy, and feminism. The Diamondback ended this “War of Pens” and ceased article writing about the matter.
    “On what could be considered a particularly conservative campus in the 1950s, the Diamondback editorial staff said that War of Pens had permeated every part of campus life,” UMDarchives’s site wrote.</p>
